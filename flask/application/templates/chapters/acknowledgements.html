<p>I am indebted to many great people, but top among them is the man, appropriately enough, at the top: In February, Daily News Editor in Chief Arthur Browne offered me the truly bizarre assignment of writing a serialized novel about Mike Pence, Donald Trump and the 25th Amendment. I appreciate his support.</p>

<p>But this book also could not have happened without: Daily News Head of Content/Features Katherine Pushkar, whose editing suggestions helped eliminate many unintelligible passages and gratuitous penis jokes; my Daily News colleagues Stephen Rex Brown, Adam Edelman, Meera Jagannathan and Jason Silverstein, who let me buy them dinner and bill the company so I could complain about my plot problems; other key News employees such as Isaac Lopez (who designed a great cover), Jon Blackwell (who copy edited this book nice and clean), Jenna Bouchard and Jeffrey Mariano (for a gorgeous design), Joe Murphy and Kelli R. Parker (for making it all look so good on the web), and in-house counsel Matt Leish (who I made very nervous repeatedly); amazing illustrations by the Pulitzer-worthy Bill Bramhall; my lawyer Kurt Hirsch, who advised me against including anything <q>actionable,</q> but then vowed to defend me anyway; Fordham Law Professor John Feerick, who really did help draft the 25th Amendment; top lawyer Bennett Gershman, who reminded me just how many guns are in private hands in this country, so there should definitely be some armed insurrection in the book; Bill Carney and the Jug Addicts, whose February show at Barb√®s in Park Slope unwittingly inspired my descent into bluegrass intrigue; Angela Stach, who read every word and mopped my fevered brow; Eric Oleson, who is already storyboarding our forthcoming money-losing off-off-Broadway production of <q>The Trump Coup</q> for the 2018 Fringe Festival; my ex-wife, Julie Rosenberg, who still gets it; David Shenk, who discouraged me from taking every wrong turn that I ended up taking anyway; and my parents, who support Donald Trump, but hope that the plot of this book actually comes true.</p>
