<h1>The final days of Donald Trump — a look back</h1>
{% include 'includes/social.html' %}

<p class="date">Friday, June 30, 2042</p>

<p class="dropcap">It’s an historic night here on CRAPY!,” said longtime anchorman Jake Tapper, now 73. <q>Not since the merger of CNN, RT, Apple, Paramount and Yum! Brands in 2032 has this network undertaken such a monumental production as tonight’s premiere of our documentary, ‘The Trump Coup: The Rise, Short Reign and Fall of President Donald J. Trump.’</q></p>

<p>Tapper was grayer and paunchier than he was during 2017, when, as a CNN broadcaster, he anchored wall-to-wall, 24-7 coverage of the last days of the Trump Administration, which for years afterwards seemed a historic footnote, like the 31-day tenure of William Henry Harrison, but was reconsidered by historians after WikiLeaks published secret Russian intelligence files in 2030.</p>

<p>CRAPY! decided to mark the first successful use of the 25th Amendment with, appropriately enough, a 25th anniversary special in the form of a commissioned documentary from top film director Reginald Gillespie and a two-hour <q>special report,</q> <q>The Unmaking of the President, 2017: A Look Back at The Trump Coup,</q> hosted, of course, by Tapper.</p>

<p>CRAPY! was airing the documentary and special on phones, computers, glasses, car back seats, refrigerator panels, and even old-style televisions. The network’s Yum! Brands division was offering discounted fried chicken at KFC’s all over the nation as well. </p>

<p><q>I want to start by bringing in Reggie Gillespie, who spent two years working on this documentary for us,</q> Tapper said. <q>Of course, Gillespie needs no introduction. From his first film in 2014, the arthouse hit, ‘The Secret Life of Archibald Ferryman,’ and his Oscar-nominated 2019 American history epic, ‘Teapot Dome,’ Reginald Gillespie has built a career trying to decode iconic and easily misunderstood figures. His 2023 documentary, <q>Boehner!</q> won an Oscar for its depiction of former House Speaker John Boehner as a legislative genius done in only by daddy issues and a theretofore unknown inability to say the word ‘gavel.’ Gillespie followed that up with another political film, this time a racy adult-themed history picture, called ‘The Alien and Seduction Act,’ which explored the theretofore unknown relationship between John Adams and every single one of Thomas Jefferson’s slaves, male and female. So, welcome, Mr. Gillespie, to CRAPY!</q></p>

<p><q>It’s great to be here,</q> Gillespie said.</p>

<br>
<hr class="fancy">

<p><q>Let’s start with your new movie, ‘The Trump Coup.’ What did you find most fascinating about re-examining the history?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, much of the history was very well known, of course — how vice president Pence, citing President Trump’s well-documented mental instability, persuaded a majority of the cabinet to join him and evoke the 25th Amendment to topple Trump,</q> Gillespie began. <q>So most of my film focuses on the 21 days of hearings and secret meetings held by Congress to determine which man would end up in the White House.</q></p>

<p><q>What surprised you?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, for one thing, I didn’t know what a complete phony Paul Ryan was,</q> Gillespie said.</p>

<p><q>You’re talking about former House Speaker Paul Ryan, who ended up being removed from power by his own fellow Republicans in 2018 amid mounting evidence that he did not know any math beyond fifth grade,</q> Tapper said.</p>

    {% include 'includes/ad02.html' %}

<p><q>Yes. But remember, this was back in 2017, when Ryan had a reputation as the intellectual giant of his party,</q> Gillespie said. <q>But my research discovered that he ended up voting against restoring Trump to office because Pence promised him a new Precor S3.45 Strength System — which not a lot of congressmen can afford on their salaries!</q></p>

<p><q>Of course, no one knew that at the time,</q> Tapper said. <q>In fact, Ryan presented himself during those 21 days as someone who was fed up with President Trump’s abuse, conspiracy theories and anatomical attacks.</q></p>

<p><q>Well, he did at one point call Paul Ryan ‘Mangled Member Eddie Munster’ after Ryan refused to bring Trump’s health care bill to the floor again,</q> Gillespie said.</p>

<p><q>I believe we have a clip of the climactic moment,</q> Tapper said.</p>

<div class="full-width">
    <img src="{{response.app.url_root}}static/img/26-trump.png" alt="A cartoon drawing of Donald Trump with his pants down being measured by a House page while Dr. Phil Marriott looks on">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The film segment showed Ryan, presiding over the House of Representatives, grilling then-former President Trump inside the House chamber, which had been reconfigured like a courtroom, as it had for the Senate’s impeachment trial of William Jefferson Clinton. Ryan’s questioning focused on Trump’s mental state.</p>

<p><q>Mr. Trump, you once tweeted that Acting President Pence has a small penis,</q> Ryan said. <q>How do you know this, sir, and why is it relevant?</q></p>

<p><q>I know it because it’s obvious,</q> Trump said. <q>And you can’t make America great again with a small penis. ‘Great again’ equals ‘big penis.’ And when we’re talking about mine, I assure you, there’s no problem.</q></p>

<p><q>Mr. Trump, in legal terms, you have opened the door to the following question,</q> Ryan said. <q>Can you remove your pants so we can verify the length and girth of your penis?</q></p>

<p>The footage showed the historic moment when Trump pulled down his slacks and then removed his light carnation pink Mar-a-Lago underwear in front of a House page who stood ready with a ruler.</p>

<p><q>Five point two centimeters, Mr. Speaker!</q> the page reported.</p>

<p><q>Huge!</q> Trump chortled.</p>

<p><q>Um, sir, that is the equivalent of two-and-one-sixteenth inches, sir,</q> the page answered.</p>

<p><q>Another metric system outrage!</q> Trump thundered. <q>It’s because you House guys always have the air conditioner blasting. It’s just normal shrinkage!</q></p>

<p>Ryan pounded his gavel. <q>Order!</q></p>

<p>Mr. Trump then grabbed his Android phone and tweeted out a picture taken from a more favorable angle: <q>Don’t believe mangled member Eddie Munster. This is the real DJT. A Subway footlong. House trial is sad.</q></p>

<p>Tapper and Gillespie returned to the screen.</p>

<blockquote><q>First of all, nothing in the Constitution requires a President to have a long penis, or even a penis at all, though we forget that part.</q></blockquote>

<p><q>Would you say that was the moment when it all turned south for Trump’s bid to regain the presidency, Mr. Gillespie?</q></p>

<p><q>It was pretty bad,</q> Gillespie said. <q>First of all, nothing in the Constitution requires a President to have a long penis, or even a penis at all, though we forget that part. But in that moment, Trump revealed so much: his phallocentric paranoia, his inability to accept objective facts, his rage towards Ryan. And the pink underwear did not help solidify public opinion, either.</q></p>

<p><q>I suppose I should point out to our younger viewers that this kind of thing was not common in those days, 25 years ago,</q> Tapper said. <q>If you were born in, say, 2017, you grew up awash in nude imagery of the President, thanks to the Booker Administration of 2024 and his successor, President Bryan Harper in 2032. But back in 2017, it was not normal for a President to pose nude for ESPN’s Body Issue.</p>

    {% include 'includes/ad03.html' %}

<p><q>Let me bring in Katy Tur here,</q> Tapper continued. <q>Katy is now president of 3DVRNWS, which didn’t even exist when she covered the Trump campaign for NBC News in 2015 and 2016, but is now the leading provider of immersive programming with more news annual viewers than NBC, CBS and ABC had from 2021 until their eventual demise in 2029. Katy, you watched the clip from Mr. Gillespie’s documentary. But you were at those hearings in June, 2017. What else struck you?</q></p>

<p><q>Well, Jake, nothing surprised me about Donald Trump in those days,</q> Tur said. <q>Remember, this was a guy who would whip up his supporters at campaign rallies by telling them that ‘Fake News Katy Tur’ was in the press pen. But I had no idea he would invoke me at a hearing instead of trying to save his presidency.</q></p>

<p><q>I believe we have a clip of that, too,</q> Tapper said.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Again, the setting was the House chamber. Trump was still at the defense table, this time being examined by Dr. Phil Marriott, a board-certified psychologist who had been hired by the House to diagnose the former president, who many professionals believed exhibited at least seven of the nine traits on the Narcissistic Personality Disorder scale (any five or more indicates severe NPD).</p>

<p><q>Mr. Trump,</q> Dr. Marriott began. <q>You seem to believe that your political opponents make up falsities to embarrass you, isn’t that correct, sir?</q></p>

<p><q>That’s largely correct, doctor, if indeed you are a doctor — I don’t believe in psychology, nor do most Second Amendment people — but if you say you’re a doctor, that’s nice for your mother. To answer your question, everything negative that is said about me is simply fake news, like the kind put out by ‘Fake News Katy Tur,’ who I know is in the gallery right now and who my supporters will now boo,</q> Trump said.</p>

<p>On cue, loud boos were, indeed, heard from the gallery.</p>

<p><q>Those are the real patriots,</q> Trump said, pointing to the boo producers. <q>You, doctor, are something right out of Nazi Germany.</q></p>

<p>The clip ended and Tapper returned to Tur.</p>

<blockquote><q>I don’t believe in psychology, nor do most Second Amendment people — but if you say you’re a doctor, that’s nice for your mother. To answer your question, everything negative that is said about me is simply fake news.</q></blockquote>

<p><q>What happened after that?</q> he asked.</p>

<p><q>Oh, it was spell-binding,</q> Tur said. <q>The doctor turned to Ryan and said something like, ‘I really don’t need to do a formal examination. The man is coo-coo crazy,’ and then he pointed his finger at his skull just above his left ear and rotated it — the universal sign for ‘This man is crazy.’ I felt it was pretty much over at that point.</q></p>

<p><q>Where was Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer during all of this?</q> Tapper asked.</p>

<p><q>It was interesting, because all of the senators were in the House chamber, except Schumer, who was back in New York calling for Times Square to be entirely pedestrianized, which was apparently a big issue in New York.</q></p>

<br>
<hr class="fancy">

<p class="dropcap">At this point, Tapper introduced a full panel of commentators who either covered the historic event or were at the center of it. CRAPY! had installed two tables to handle the crowd. The left table was basically the pro-Trump camp: former press secretary Sean Spicer, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Lucian Wintrich, who was a conservative performance artist and provocateur until Trump’s election vaulted him to the lofty perch of White House correspondent for the right-wing website Gateway Pundit. Wintrich is now president of Facebook-Time Warner.</p>

<p>The other table featured Tur; a bubbling tank containing the floating body of former ABC News host George Stephanopoulos, now 81; and former MSNBC show host Rachel Maddow, making her return to television after a 25-year absence.</p>

<p><q>Let’s start with you, Rachel,</q> Tapper said. <q>I notice your face is completely covered with that scarf —</q></p>

<p><q>It’s Ivanka By Ivanka, by the way,</q> Maddow joked, reducing the tension.</p>

<p><q>You still got it, Rachel,</q> Tapper said. <q>But seriously, I guess the scars haven’t healed, even now?</q></p>

<p><q>I’m not sure they’ve healed for any of us, Jake,</q> Maddow said.</p>

<p>Wintrich jumped in.</p>

<p><q>Oh, come on, Rachel — you brought this whole thing on yourself. For almost all of the Congressional debate on Trump, you got increasingly worked up. There was one point where it looked like Trump would prevail and you did a 76-minute opening monologue  — breaking Keith Olbermann’s record by two minutes! — listing every one of Trump’s supposed crimes, including his harmless tweets about the booming ‘Apprentice’ ratings after Omarosa replaced failing Arnold Schwarzenegger. I thought you were going to implode right then and there.</q></p>

<p><q>Please, Mr. Wintrich, I would ask you to show some sensitivity in your word choice, given what happened,</q> Tapper said. <q>Rachel, maybe you could talk us through it.</q></p>

<p><q>All I can tell you is that spontaneous combustion is a real thing,</q> Maddow said.</p>

<p><q>I believe we have a clip,</q> Tapper said.</p>

<blockquote><q>She’s on fire! Her rhetoric! Her passion! I’ve never seen anything like —. Get a fire extinguisher!</q></blockquote>

<p>The scene shifted to Maddow’s once-familiar red, white and blue MSNBC set, with the unblemished host behind the desk, a screen over her shoulder just said, <q>The Pence Coup in Congress: The Vote.</q> Maddow was addressing members of Congress and getting increasingly agitated.</p>

<p><q>I don’t know what is wrong with you people!</q> she started yelling. <q>The evidence is clear; the President is insane. You, Congressman Duncan Hunter — this President has betrayed you with his Coast Guard cuts, forcing you to deal with 600 screaming constituents at a town hall in March. You, Rep. Marsha Blackburn. You defended Trump when he was bragging about grabbing women by the pussy. And then he repaid you by forcing you to defend Jeff Sessions after he lied to Congress about his contacts with the Russians. And you, Devin Nunes. Why are you running around saying the whole thing is a CIA plot — yet producing no evidence? And you, Sen. Mitch McConnell. Are you really going to vote in favor of a madman who keeps saying Mexico will not only pay for our wall, but also for the one Russian is building around the eastern border of Ukraine? What is wrong with you, people? Donald Trump is a liar. He is a maniac! He is dangerous to —</q></p>

<p>There was a flash of light, which overexposed the cameras. By the time technicians reduced the aperture, Maddow’s hair, face and clothing were on fire.</p>

<p><q>She’s on fire! Her rhetoric! Her passion! I’ve never seen anything like —. Get a fire extinguisher,</q> a cameraman yelled before the clip cut out.</p>

<p><q>Rachel, that must have been difficult to watch,</q> Tapper said.</p>

<p><q>Actually, in retrospect, I really did get a little worked up,</q> Maddow said.</p>

<p>Jeff Sessions finally jumped in. <q>The irony, of course, is that Mr. Nunes was right — it was a CIA plot!</q></p>

<p>Tapper wasn’t sure.</p>

<blockquote><q>I have on very good authority, the best authority, beautiful authority, that Mike Pence was brainwashed by the CIA! I don’t know how they did it, but they turned him against me!</q></blockquote>

<p><q>I believe you are talking about the rumored CIA operation to implant negative memories about Donald Trump in Mike Pence’s head and begin the coup?</q></p>

<p><q>I am, Jake,</q> Sessions said. <q>Too bad it ended up going so badly for President Trump.</q></p>

<p><q>I believe we have a clip of that, too,</q> Tapper said.</p>

<p>Again, the scene changed to the hearing room, with Trump again at the table.</p>

<p><q>I have on very good authority, the best authority, beautiful authority, that Mike Pence was brainwashed by the CIA!</q> Trump thundered. <q>I don’t know how they did it, but they turned him against me!</q></p>

<p>The footage again shows Dr. Marriott making the <q>crazy</q> sign against his temple — this time punctuating it with a silly whistle. </p>

<p><q>So President Trump ended up looking even more like a fool — even though I believe he was right!</q> Sessions said.</p>

<p>Tapper wanted to get back to a broader issue.</p>

<p><q>In the end, how should we look back on the Trump administration and Pence’s successful takeover?</q> he asked. <q>Let me start with you, Rachel.</q></p>

<p><q>In the end, I ignited myself over something that was ultimately minor, especially given how much real damage to the country President Pence ended up doing,</q> Maddow said. <q>Perhaps I was naive.</q></p>

<p><q>What ‘damage’ are you talking about, Rachel?</q> asked Spicer. <q>After lying for Donald Trump for six months, I found President Pence to be a delightful return to normalcy.</q></p>

<p><q>Normalcy?</q> said Stephanopolous. <q>Do you even remember your first press conference after Pence took over?</q></p>

<p><q>I believe we have a clip,</q> Tapper said.</p>

    {% include 'includes/ad04.html' %}

<p class="dropcap">The scene shifted to a chaotic White House briefing room, whose walls were still charred from Steve Bannon’s failed suicide bombing of the day before (Bannon had botched the attack so badly that not only did he survive, but the explosion ended up killing Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks, whose last words were, <q>I’m not dying. That’s fake news. I’m alive and well — Obamacare is what’s killing me!</q>).</p>

<p><q>President Pence issued four executive orders this morning,</q> Spicer began. <q>The first one, which we are calling ‘The Hamilton Rule,’ bans any actors from addressing audience members from the stage. The second calls for a Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, same-sex fornication and same-sex drinking at bars, which could lead to the aforementioned same-sex fornication. The third one calls for re-funding Planned Parenthood so that, tomorrow, President Pence can double de-fund Planned Parenthood as well as everything connected to abortion: national parks that have been visited by doctors who once performed an abortion; repair of interstate highways driven upon by women who have had an abortion or known someone who has had an abortion; Pell grants to any medical school that teaches about the female reproductive system’s ability to carry to term embryos that were somehow created outside of marriage. And the final one allows any company to discriminate against anyone on religious grounds or for any other reason.</q></p>

<p>The clip ended and Stephanopulos’ floating body spoke.</p>

<p><q>In some ways, Sean is right; it was a return to conservative normalcy,</q> Stephanopoulos said.</p>

<p><q>You’re just bitter, George,</q> Wintrich said. <q>There’s a reason they put Mike Pence’s face on the $25 coin.</q></p>

<p><q>Yeah, but that never would’ve happened without all that help from the Russians and the CIA,</q> Stephanopolous said.</p>

<p><q>George, I believe you’re referring to the 2030 WikiLeaks dump of the 2017 memo that confirmed President Trump and President Putin’s secret pact to seize all the world’s remaining fossil fuel reserves and corner the market?</q></p>

<p><q>I believe we have a clip,</q> Tapper said.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Again, the setting was the House chamber. An off-camera congressman was asking a question about the President’s ties to Russia, brandishing a memo suggesting that Trump and Putin were in cahoots, with Energy Secretary Rick Perry serving as a conduit.</p>

<p><q>But our own CIA says you and Putin —</q> the Congressman said.</p>

<p><q>Look, I don’t know Putin. I have no dealings with him,</q> Trump said. <q>Do I think he’s a great leader? Yes, I do. Would I make a secret deal with him to divide up the world’s fossil fuel reserves and corner the market? Sure, I would. Wouldn’t it be great for the U.S. and Russia to get along — and if we can all make a profit, isn’t that better?</q></p>

<p>The clip ended, and Wintrich jumped in.</p>

<p><q>I still think Trump was right, regardless of what the memo actually revealed about Putin’s secret payoffs,</q> he said.</p>

<p><q>You’re OK with secret payoffs, huh? Were you screaming in 1993 when Bill Clinton let campaign contributors spend a night in the Lincoln Bedroom?</q></p>

<p><q>I was 4,</q> Wintrich said. <q>Who’s Bill Clinton and why would anyone care if the President sold the Lincoln Bedroom to campaign contributors? Pence’s only error was that he unshackled the 25th Amendment — then didn’t see it coming when they came for him!</q></p>

<p><q>Perhaps we should stop there, since we’re talking only about the events that ended the Trump Administration, and not what happened after,</q> Tapper said, turning to the camera. <q>So enjoy Reginald Gillespie’s documentary, ‘The Trump Coup: The Rise, Short Reign and Fall of President Donald J. Trump’ — and maybe get ready for a sequel, Mr. Gillespie?</q></p>

<p><q>It was pretty wild what happened. I’ll consider it,</q> he said.</p>
