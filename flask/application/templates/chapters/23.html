<h1>Ivanka Trump has a vision</h1>
{% include 'includes/social.html' %}

<p class="date">Friday, June 23, 2017</p>

<p class="dropcap">Ivanka Trump was at a photo shoot when she heard the news that Mike Pence had overthrown her father.</p>

<p>Shiny objects sparkled on a table beneath umbrella-covered studio lighting:  medium thin diamond hoop earrings from her <q>Black and White</q> collection ($3,950); woven disk pavé diamond earrings from her <q>Aberdeen</q> collection with a design that the untrained eye might have thought came from a Dublin souvenir shop ($6,200); an elongated Swiss blue topaz, honey citrine and diamond ring from the <q>Empire</q> collection that would have looked good on a showgirl in Baz Luhrmann’s campy version of <q>The Great Gatsby</q> ($2,920); a thin diamond wedding band with pavé diamonds spelling out the initials <q>IT,</q> as if others besides Jared Kushner intended to wed the First Daughter ($1,100); and Trump’s favorite bauble, a diamond cluster necklace from the <q>Montmartre</q> collection that resembled a brighter version of the charm bracelets kids buy their moms at Kay Jewelers ($9,560).</p>

<div class="full-width">
    <img src="{{response.app.url_root}}static/img/23-ivanka.png" alt="A cartoon drawing of Ivanka Trump covered with lots of jewels">
</div>

<p>Each piece of jewelry was paired with Ivanka Trump <q>Wise Words.</q> <q>Contribute to the greater good!</q> read a card beside a $1,240 diamond with oval element ring from the <q>Affinity</q> collection; <q>Know when to compromise and when to stand firm</q> was next to pavé diamond oval earrings ($39,500); and the Tassel seed pearl and diamond earrings for $12,500 had a card that said, <q>Find out what you like doing best and get someone to pay you to do it.</q></p>

<p>Every time the photographer’s shutter popped, the studio lights flashed off the diamonds, cut glass and metal like sparklers on the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>The light temporarily blinded Ivanka. But then the light revealed all.</p>

    {% include 'includes/ad02.html' %}

<p><q>You must go to Washington, Ivanka,</q> the $15,900 Liberté diamond collar necklace seemed to say. <q>You must lead this nation. And you must wear open frame diamond cuffs from the Metropolis collection — just $13,900 each — on both arms as you do so.</q></p>

<p><q>Wait, what?</q> asked Ivanka, startled and a bit frightened. <q>Am I seeing a vision? Is that you, Archangel Michael?</q></p>

<p><q>Archangel Michael?!</q> the jewelry responded. <q>Sorry, Ivanka, but you’re no Joan of Arc. No, I’m St. Leonard, the patron saint of all political prisoners, imprisoned people, prisoners of war, women in labor, and, I don’t like to brag, horses.</q></p>

<p><q>What do you want from me?</q></p>

<p><q>I don’t want anything. I’m dead. But I’m speaking to you through your jewelry. Angels like me, we can only speak through the things in which people believe, or else God himself would have come down. And you believe in this crap.</q></p>

<blockquote><q>I’m St. Leonard, the patron saint of all political prisoners, imprisoned people, prisoners of war, women in labor, and, I don’t like to brag, horses.</q></blockquote>

<p><q>So what should I do?</q></p>

<p><q>Look a little closer — directly into the pavé-cut diamonds — and tell me what you see?</q></p>

<p><q>I see some amazing craftsmanship, and a really good value at just $1,250,</q> Ivanka answered.</p>

<p><q>Jeez, you’re like Thomas the Apostle — OK, doubting Ivanka, I’ll show you myself!</q></p>

<p>A vision burst fully into Ivanka’s head: She saw her father chained to a gilded Chippendale desk in his Mar-a-Lago bedroom, struggling against  restraints to reach a bookcase filled with copies of <q>The Art of the Deal.</q> She saw him grab a pen off the desk, sign a piece of paper, and hold it up to non-existent photographers as if it was an executive order, but the paper was blank. Then the scene changed. She saw Steve Bannon, flanked by two armed guards, watching and rewatching his Ronald Reagan hagiography, <q>In the Face of Evil.</q> She saw Kellyanne Conway on television talking about how the 25th Amendment did not actually exist. She saw Reince Priebus ordering a pizza from Domino’s and having trouble with the operator (<q>It’s ‘i’ before ‘e’ except in ‘Reince,’ but definitely in ‘Priebus,’</q> he said).</p>

<p>She saw one more vision — Mike Pence, sitting behind the Resolute desk in the Oval Office having tea with Hillary Clinton — before the scene shifted again. Now, she saw herself. There she was, wearing an armor-trimmed black-and gold Alexander McQueen gown. There she was, leading an army of rifle-toting Americans from her $5.5-million mansion in Kalorama to the White House, where Mike Pence had torn down the illuminated gold <q>TRUMP</q> sign.</p>

    {% include 'includes/ad02.html' %}

<p><q>This is madness, St. Leonard!</q> Ivanka protested. <q>But I do love that dress!</q></p>

<p><q>It is not madness, Ivanka, it is your destiny,</q> St. Leonard counseled.</p>

<p><q>Destiny? To take up arms and restore my father’s rightful place in the White House?</q></p>

<p><q>I don’t think you’re looking close enough. See, look deeper into the rainbow moonstone in your own diamond pendant from the Patras collection, a steal in white gold at $3,000.</q></p>

<p>Indeed, this time when Ivanka looked into that particular piece of  jewelry she noticed that the armed men and women  wore <q>Pence</q> armbands and <q>Alive with 25!</q> buttons. </p>

<p><q>Let’s restore sanity to the presidency!</q> one man yelled.</p>

<p><q>Pence is even more conservative than Trump — and we can trust him!</q> yelled another.</p>

<p><q>And he would never grab anyone by the pussy!</q> added Chelsea Clinton, who was holding both a machete and Ivanka’s hand.</p>

<p><q>Wait a second, St. Leonard, why am I leading an insurrection against my father — with Chelsea Clinton?</q></p>

<p><q>My dear, your destiny and your father’s destiny are not the same,</q> the saint said. <q>And, you know what? You should call Chelsea every once in a blue moon. She’s always been a good sounding board.</q></p>

<p>And with that, the glare from the jewelry dissipated and St. Leonard vanished.</p>
